~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Unzip the 7 files to any directory and run Kbap.exe

Egavga.bgi
Kbap.exe
Pallette.col
ReadMe.txt (this file)
Softrock.fnt

Make sure that all the files are in the same directory.

3. Troubleshooting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Make sure that all the files are in the same directory.
Also make sure that the file "Data2.dat" is writable. Remove 'Read-Only' attribute if there. Problem will also occur if you have all the files on a 'write-protected' disc.

Please report any problem you experience to kgab5709@gmail.com with "Problems using KBAP" in subject line.

Hope that you enjoy the game.
